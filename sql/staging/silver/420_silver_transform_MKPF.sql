-- Project : Procure-to-Pay Data Platform
-- Layer   : staging
-- Folder  : silver
-- File    : 420_silver_transform_MKPF.sql
--
-- Purpose :
--   Transform raw bronze material document header (MKPF) data into a cleaned,
--   standardized silver representation suitable for operational loading.
--
-- Description:
--   This script refines material document header data from the staging bronze
--   table into the staging silver table. The silver layer represents the
--   cleaned and standardized stage of the medallion architecture.
--
--   Typical transformations performed at this stage include:
--     - Type normalization and safe casting (dates, numerics, codes)
--     - Canonical formatting (trimming, casing, standard date formats)
--     - Basic field-level validation (required fields, value ranges)
--     - Deduplication using stable business keys (where applicable)
--     - Standardization of null handling and default values
--
--   No cross-table referential integrity constraints are enforced in the
--   staging layer. Relational consistency is enforced later when loading
--   into the operational schema.
--
-- Inputs :
--   staging.bronze_mkpf
--
-- Outputs:
--   staging.silver_mkpf
--
-- Execution Context:
--   Executed by the staging refinement DAG after successful bronze ingestion.
--   Typically runs after 320_bronze_load_MKPF.sql has completed.
--
-- Notes :
--   - Records that fail validation may be filtered out, corrected, or routed
--     to a rejects/quarantine mechanism depending on pipeline design.
--   - Keep silver deterministic and repeatable to support reproducibility
--     and testing.
