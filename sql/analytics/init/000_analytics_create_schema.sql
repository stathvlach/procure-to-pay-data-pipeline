-- Project : Procure-to-Pay Data Platform
-- Layer   : analytics
-- Folder  : init
-- File    : 000_analytics_create_schema.sql
--
-- Purpose :
--   Create the analytics schema used as the enterprise reporting and
--   dimensional modeling layer for the Procure-to-Pay domain.
--
-- Description:
--   This script initializes the analytics database schema, which serves as
--   the consumption layer for BI and reporting workloads. The analytics
--   layer is expected to host curated dimensional models (e.g., star schema)
--   and derived metrics built from operational system-of-record data.
--
--   No tables, constraints, or seed data are defined in this script.
--   All dimensional/fact table definitions and seeds are provided in
--   subsequent analytics initialization and configuration scripts.
--
-- Inputs :
--   None.
--
-- Outputs:
--   Database schema: analytics
--
-- Execution Context:
--   Executed during database initialization as part of platform scaffolding.
--   The script is idempotent and safe to re-run.
--
-- Notes :
--   The analytics schema is intentionally isolated from staging and
--   operational schemas to separate reporting workloads from transactional
--   processing and to enable independent evolution of the BI model.
