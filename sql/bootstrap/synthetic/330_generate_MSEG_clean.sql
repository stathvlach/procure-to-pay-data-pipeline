-- Folder  : synthetic
-- File    : 330_generate_MSEG_clean.sql
--
-- Purpose:
--   Generate clean material document items (MSEG) data representing
--   valid, well-formed external source system output.
--
-- Description:
--   This script generates a synthetic but semantically valid dataset
--   for material docmument items (MSEG). The generated data represents
--   the expected output of an external procurement system under normal
--   operating conditions, without data quality issues or corruption.
--
--   The dataset produced here serves as the "clean" baseline used to:
--     - Export landing files (CSV / JSON / XML), and
--     - Act as input for controlled corruption scenarios defined
--       in subsequent bootstrap scripts.
--
--   No corruption rules are applied in this script. All records comply
--   with expected structural and business-level constraints.
--
-- Inputs:
--   Reference and master data from the operational schema, including:
--     - Company codes
--     - Vendors
--     - Purchasing organizations and document types
--
-- Outputs:
--   Clean synthetic MSEG dataset, persisted temporarily within the
--   bootstrap schema and/or exported as landing files.
--
-- Execution Context:
--   Executed as part of the bootstrap synthetic data generation workflow.
--   Typically run prior to the corresponding corrupted data generator.
--
-- Notes:
--   This script intentionally does not enforce relational constraints
--   to downstream documents (EKPO, MSEG, RSEG). Such relationships are
--   resolved later in the data pipeline.
